# SND-LHC
Work Done for Pic 22-23

NOTE:The programs provided do not have interactive input capabilities, which means that if you want to input a parameter or constant, you will need to manually modify the code rather than providing input through the terminal;
     It was use the the Genie GTS TTree to obtain the simulated values.
     All code files shared is work done thowards the Pic 22-23.


-acosad.cpp was designed to adjust a number to fall within specific boundaries, but it was ultimately not utilized.

-enele.cpp calculates the distribution of events across different energy levels. The results obtained from this program were scaled to align with the experimental quantities observed during the 3rd run of the LHC.

-enemom.cpp program calculates the total energy of the decay products and represents as a function of the incoming neutrino that initiated the decay.

-mom.cpp performs a similar calculation as enemom.cpp, but specifically for the three different components of momentum.

-ag.cpp and ag1.cpp calculate the reconstructed momentum magnitude and energy of the lepton, as well as the reconstructed neutrino energy. These results are then represented as functions of the expected values.

-ttree.cpp and ttree2.cpp are files that likely serve as a reminder or reference for the functionality of the ROOT framework, which is commonly used for data analysis in high-energy physics.

-divenrg.cpp is used to determine the uncertainty of our method. It likely involves analyzing the variations or discrepancies in energy calculations or measurements to assess the reliability or accuracy of the method.

-randomm.cpp is used to introduce uncertainties to the jet angle and momentum. Additionally, it is use to determine the uncertainty associated with the energy reconstruction of the neutrino
